## Board 1 - contact information

![Horizontal example](hw2-board-1.jpg)

What's dynamic about this panel is that its subtle and there isnt to much going on. what's special about this panel is that in a small amount of spcae i'm able to display my name, mayjor, graduation year and email. This design is a more old timey feeling calling card.

## Board 2 - Adventure

![](hw2-board-2.jpg)

I selected adventure because it's an intresting theme because i'm able to dipict the adventure in their story and trip. I love this panel because it dipicts their happy go lucky attidude as they are strolling along towars their destination of picking up money for themselves. 

## Board 3 - Creativity

I selected creativity because I wanted to show it depicted as the frogs were clever enough to figure out a way to play makeshift bowling using mushrooms as the pins to pass the time on their long trip towards getting their money.

## Board 4 - Passion

![](hw2-board-4.jpg)

I selected passion because I wanted to dipict how powerful money can be and the deep serious emotions it can bring out of you, and make you do things out of passion. It can make a friend turn on a friend in a blink of an eye. 

## Board 6 - Closing panel

For my closing panel I wanted to dipict the frog celebrating that he was able to snatch the money for himself, even though it cost betraying the other frogs.  

# Reflection

I enjoyed this assignement because I was able to be creative by showing a custom storyboard. I wouldnt do anyhting diffrent very good simple project that was able to make me feel more comfortable working in VS Code.
